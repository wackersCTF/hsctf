I actually did not manage to get the flag for this challenge, but I ended up with the first part of the code to solve it.

The problem our team had with this challenge was with sending input to the terminal. Oftentimes I got a TLE error which was
frustating since I knew the actual "solving part" of my code was correct.

I attached two py files in this folder. One was written by my teammate Wyl3Wak which precomputes solutions to avoid the problem
with the time limit. My approach is probably slower and doesn't work though since I didn't get the terminal working, I'm not
exactly sure.


The code is very similar to extended-fibonacci
